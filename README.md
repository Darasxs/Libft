The goal of this project is to create a custom C library that replicates many of the essential functions from the standard C library. Through this project, I've implemented a variety of commonly used functions from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of how they work under the hood. This library serves as a foundation for future projects at 42, reinforcing my skills in memory management, string manipulation, and data structures in C.
